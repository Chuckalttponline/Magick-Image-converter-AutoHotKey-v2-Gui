My Script uses Magick image converter as a DLL and passes the needed pramitors to it.
I recomend checking out the original command line tool at > https://imagemagick.org/script/convert.php  Its goodðŸ˜Ž...


"Magick Image converter Gui.exe" is ready to use just run it and it will extract a "magick.dll" which is what does the image converting. If you want to edit the Gui I left in an icon "IDR_MAGICKICON.ico" and the AutoHotKey v2 source code for the Gui "Magick Image converter Gui.ahk" to get a "magick.dll" either run "Magick Image converter Gui.exe" or download the latest version of Magick image converter, copy "magick.exe" and name it to "magick.dll". Then you can edit the AutoHotKey v2 code and compile using the icon.
